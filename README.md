# Challenge Encryptor Decryptor
# Oracle Next Education G6 Challenge 1: Encryptor/Decryptor

Welcome to the first challenge for the Oracle Next Education G6 program! This project focuses on creating an encryptor and decryptor using the combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Encryption Keys
In this challenge, we will use the following encryption keys:
- "e" converts to "enter"
- "i" converts to "imes"
- "a" converts to "ai"
- "o" converts to "ober"
- "u" converts to "ufat"

## Requirements
- The application should work only with lowercase letters.
- Do not use letters with accents or special characters.
- It should be possible to convert a word to its encrypted version and vice versa.

### Examples:
- "gato" => "gaitober"
- "gaitober" => "gato"

Happy coding! ğŸš€
